# CPSC353_Highlight.js

This project is for CPSC 353.

First want to say how much I enjoyed this project,  I really struggled with the first project and was pretty sad about that.  So feeling much better about this one.  

The point of this userscript is to check for phishing by checking the href value with it's anchor text.

Tapermonkey was very interesting to learn, however I couldn't get the script running. And wasn't sure if I was supposed to run it on any site or run it locally.  Not sure if it's because it's a downloaded pdf file.

I however used jsfiddle.net to run the code, here...  https://jsfiddle.net/tLcn7fee/2/
